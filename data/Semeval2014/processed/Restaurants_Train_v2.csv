based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 pm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you will pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city , and most still do not compare .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the quality of food , a little too expensive .

i live on the street this place is on .

here ' s to the fake fish tanks too . . .

the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do not like sharing tables or if the typical ra ##uc ##ous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .
