i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305 - n410bl .

one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .

i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my documents folder .
