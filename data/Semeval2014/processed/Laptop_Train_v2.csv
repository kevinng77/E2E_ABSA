they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .

one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no gui , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .

still pretty price ##y , but i have been putting off money for a while as a little mac ##book fund , and finally got to use it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the shop , these mac ##books are en ##cased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .

they were totally un ##con ##cer ##ned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .

to ##shi ##ba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .

the one down side to it is that when i play a ce ##rti ##n game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but that ##s the only bad thing about this computer .

reason why ? it ' s because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10 - 20 % , unlike pc laptop ##s which drop more than 80 % .

it is just slow slow slow .
O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you would be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an apple mac ##book pro , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##book pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy windows laptop .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so this was great for me .
O O O O O O O
this is the first mac ##book i have ever had .
O O O O O O O O O O O
the ace ##r one com ##pu ##er is a great computer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
another problem .
O O O
so , if you are thinking of a laptop , i would heart ##ily recommend the ##apple 13 . 3 mac ##book pro notebook computer ( z ##0 ##j ##80 ##00 ##1 ) notebook for all your needs !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed open ##off ##ice and fire ##fo ##x , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .

overall i feel this net ##book was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O B-neg O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .
O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O
the " time remaining " goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pay attention to the spec ##s if you want these options .
O O O O B-neu E-neu O O O O O O
stupid ##ly , mind - numb ##ingly slow - - then i found it can only be loaded with 2 ##gb * maximum * .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have blue ##tooth .
O O O O O B-neg E-neg O
sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .
O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O
great battery life .
O B-pos E-pos O
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it ' s speed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O B-pos O
at first , the computer seemed a great deal - - seemingly high - end spec ##s for a low , low price .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O B-pos O
delivery was early too .
B-pos O O O O
during that time , i had to send it back 3 times .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end mac ##book pro , this thing holds its own .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love the stability of the mac software and operating system .
O O B-pos O O B-pos E-pos O B-pos E-pos O
and that probably explains why i have already had my sat ##a controller go bad within a year of buying it .
O O O O O O O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O
i left the place angrily .
O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a mac ##book as well !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a to ##shi ##ba laptop in the past ;
O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger mac ##book pro ##s for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .
O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O B-neu I-neu E-neu O O
as ##us said my net - book was working properly .
O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .
O O O
it has a faster processor and more ram .
O O O O B-pos O O B-pos O
if you need an affordable , entry - level laptop , this will fit the bill .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
laptop ##s are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?

i was not a big fan of the net ##books but this one was very well designed .

it may take a little getting used to but you do not have to worry about viruses or other headache ##s .

i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it back again and was told the mother ##board had been replaced , so i was now on the second mother ##board within 3 months .
O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this apple computer .

they say it could be the mother ##board again , but dell

i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its ra ##de ##on 58 ##50 would have dd ##r ##5 instead of dd ##r ##3 .

O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this notebook restart ##s every time there is a new update , so if you do not save your files and information , everything will be lost .

so not having my laptop was disco ##ura ##ging .

fully charged , the mac ##book pro can last about five hours un ##pl ##ug ##ged .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the mac ##book pro looked so appealing .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spy ##ware problems !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptop ##s , it is worth the price .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know there are way better laptop ##s out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesn ##t suck total monkey balls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neu O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me , keys were starting to get stuck and would not type very well .

i do not like this company nor the to ##shi ##ba brand , and i will never buy another one because i have put more into it then it is worth .

i have had my mac ##book for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not a mac .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have always owned a pc and decided to try a mac ##book to see what it ' s all about .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it ' s very lightweight , and the response for the computing she is doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;
O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O B-neu I-neu E-neu O O O O O O O O O O O
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .
O O O O O O O O B-neu O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this is a wonderful computer and def ##ini ##tly worth the purchase !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it came al ##ot faster than i thought it would have which was really exciting .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noon ##e that they can transfer you to .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .
O O O O O O B-pos O O O O
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .
O O O O O B-neu O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O B-pos O O O B-pos O O O O O O
but if you are in the computer field you probably would not be here .

i am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;

one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it .
