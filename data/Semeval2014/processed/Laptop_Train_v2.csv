toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .

reason why ? it ' s because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10 - 20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .

the best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u can ' t company ' s like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .
