anyways , if you ' re in the neighborhood to eat good food , i wouldn ' t waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari .

the decor is night tho . . . but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling . . . its quite un - appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .

i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency - not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .

the rice to fish ration was also good - - they didn ' t try to overpack the rice .

the service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .

the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity and quality ) .
O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !

frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .

go hungry and enjoy .

also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you don ' t .

i have never been disappointed in the red eye .

the first time i went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , i ordered the lobster cobb salad .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O B-pos O O O O O O O O
i ' ve never ordered anything else from their menu . . . there ' s no need to .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s simply the best meal in nyc .
O O O O O O B-pos O O O
you cannot go wrong at the red eye grill .
O O O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O
if we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O
we ' ve lived in the area for more than 8 years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is cute but not upscale .
O B-neu O O O O O O
the food is a diamond in rough - - the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O
i would highly recommend it .
O O O O O O
it ' s one of our favorite places to eat in ny .

we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night .
O O O O O O O B-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O O
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .

after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .

i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .

please take my advice , go and try this place .
O O O O O O O O O B-pos O
its located in greenewich village .
O O O O O O
you will not be disapointed at all .
O O O O O O O O
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagel was huge .
O B-pos O O O
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
O O O O O O O O O O O
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it and would highly recommend .
O O O O O O O O
this was my frist time at cafe st . bart ' s and i must say how delicous the food and the service was .

when i called this morning , i didn ' t think i would be able to get in at 12 , but i was able to get in , along with four other guests .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
O O O B-pos O B-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O B-pos I-pos E-pos O
i highly recommend cafe st . bart ' s for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O B-pos O O B-pos O
all the staff is absolutely professional ! !
O O B-pos O O O O O
i sometimes see the waiters don ' t have enough knowledge of their dishes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they do .
O O O O
( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do . . . )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there ' s nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
O B-neg I-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
O B-neu E-neu O B-neu E-neu O O O O O O O
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
O B-pos O O O O O O O B-neg O
it ' s boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average . . . the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .
O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O B-neg O O O O
i definitely wouldn ' t go back .
O O O O O O O O
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is # 1 .

the price is reasonable although the service is poor .

hats off to the chef .

the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .

we had pam ' s special fried fish and it was amazing .

my husband and i both ordered the steak , medium .
O O O O O O O O O O O
i didn ' t complain , i liked the atmosphere so much .
O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O
will give it another chance before i write it off .
O O O O O O O O O O O
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
O O O O O O O O O O
ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O
we will be back .
O O O O O
it costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside - out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that ' s not just from the rice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ' ve had at this price range .
O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the yellowtail was particularly good as well .
O B-pos O O O O O O
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however - - the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
O O O O O B-neg I-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in any event , this is a place i ' ll be sure to stop by again when i ' m in this part of town .

big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment .
B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O
they have it all - - great price , food , and service .
O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O B-pos O
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
O B-neg O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
O O O O O O O O
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3 - 6 each ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O B-pos O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is always very crowded and popular .
O B-pos O O O O O O O
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .

we ' d go back again

i recently went to this restaurant with some co - workers for lunch and had an amazing time .

we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we all felt it was worth it .

sometimes i get good food and ok service .
O O O O B-pos O O B-neu O
it is not consistent .
O O O O O
really depends on your luck !
O O O O O O
the place is a bistro which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
O O O O O O O O O B-pos O B-pos O O O O O B-pos O
and where does patis go wrong ; no where .
O O O B-pos O O O O O O
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : cassuolet , steake fritte , tripe stew , etc ; simple stuff .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O B-pos O
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O
coming from boston this place is like emma ' s pizza in kendall square in cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mmmmm . . . it was delicious .
O O O O O O O O
service was slow , but the people were friendly .

the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
O B-neg E-neg O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not try unless you ' re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .

i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .

the filet mignon dish was superb !

it ' s a small cute restaurant .

i absolutely love this place ! ! !
O O O O B-pos O O O
from the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .

the sushi is amazing ! ! !

we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai .
O O O B-neg I-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot .
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O

my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny - - i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i ' m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .

highly recommended ! ! ! ! !

first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch ' s editorial review .
O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
either that , or the editor ' s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
O B-neg O O O O O O O B-neu O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc . . . .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but couldn ' t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .

to celebrate a birthday , three of us went to mare anticipating great food .

not one of our meals was edible - bland and / or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .

fish was overdone .

someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .

we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .

i can ' t believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O

the food is good , i can ' t lie .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O
but the staff was so horrible to us .
O O B-neg O O O O O O
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
O B-neg O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
O B-neg O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !

the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but overall i give it a 10

haru on park s is simply disgusting .
B-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
O B-neg O O O O O B-neg O O O O O
quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried .
O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O
will never be back .
O O O O O
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .
O O O O B-neg O O O O O O
the all - u - can - eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
O B-neg I-neg I-neg I-neg I-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O
limited menu , no - so - fresh ingredients , thinly - sliced fish , fall - apart rice .
O B-neg O O O O O O B-neg O O O O B-neg O O O O B-neg O
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar - soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O
the waitstaffs are nice though .

i have been to roth ' s twice and both times were very disappointing .
O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dinner was ok , nothing i would have again .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .

the svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !

try the pad thai , it ' s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O
just because it ' s cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !
O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s popular w / the late crowd .
O O O O O O O O O O
they forgot a sandwich , didn ' t include plastic forks , and didn ' t include pita with the hummus platter .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , not worth the money .
O O O O O O O
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it ' s a very disappointing experience .

mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O B-pos O
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
O B-neg O O O O O O O B-pos O O O
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
O B-pos O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O
even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O
the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .

went to village last night for my birthday .
O O O O O O O O O
we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we weren ' t sure what to expect .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were very pleasantly surprised .
O O O O O O
the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top - notch .
O B-pos O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O O O O
when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
O O O O O O B-pos O
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O
why ?
O O
they don ' t concern much of customer ' s health , just want to make money .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
please don ' t fool us .
O O O O O O O
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .

the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .

the large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .

( the asparagus , truffle oil , parmesan bruschetta is a winner ! )
O O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O

be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .

the wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you ' re eating in a freindly little european town .
O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from . . . maybe you dont know how things work in america . . . and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .
O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .

i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O
i wasn ' t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that ' s the price you pay for a popular place .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !
O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald ' s , every place makes things differently
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald ' s than this joint .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i absolutely loved this place .
O O O O B-pos O
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions .

my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent .

i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .

i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .

i would recommend roxy ' s for that , but not for their food .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
O O O O O O O B-neu O O O O O
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami - but it didn ' t have much taste - i ' ve had better for less elsewhere !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O

we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .

a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?

O O O O O O O O O
one of my favorite places in manhattan .
O O O O O O O O
authentic taiwanese food that ' s cheap . . . what more could you ask for ?
O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan .
O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
O O B-pos O O B-pos E-pos O
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
O O O O B-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O
delicious crab cakes too .
O B-pos E-pos O O
even if the food wasn ' t this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
O O O B-pos O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O
great neighborhood joint .
O O B-pos O
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice .
O O O O B-pos E-pos O O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O B-pos E-pos O
their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit - inducing , yuck .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O
the counter service is bad .
O B-neg E-neg O O O
they charge different prices all the time .
O O O O O O O O
they ' re rude at times , and not very friendly .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
no pizza 33 for me !
O B-neg E-neg O O O
the sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O
calling the place hampton chutney co . does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .
O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O
seriously , this place kicks ass .
O O O B-pos O O O
the atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O
best italian food i ever had ( and being italian , that means alot ) .
O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , do not pass it up .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is set far from the small street it ' s on , and there is no traffic noise .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
O B-pos O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O B-pos O O O
this is a great place to take out - of - towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .

nice value .

unique apppetizers .
O B-pos O
try sushimi cucumber roll .
O B-pos I-pos E-pos O
good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
O B-pos O O B-pos E-pos O B-pos O O O
the big complaint : no toasting available .
O O O O O O O O
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
won ' t or can ' t is not in the service directory .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but who says murray ' s is anything about service .
O O O O O O O O O B-neg O
the service is awful .
O B-neg O O O
this place is not worth the prices .
O B-neg O O O O O O
also , don ' t plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it ' s not on the menu , you can ' t have it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will be out with friends and all of a sudden i am hungry and i only crave one thing . . . their pizza .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O
it hits the spot every time
O O O O O O
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc .
O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O
even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in new york pizza restaurants ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve been many time and have never been disappointed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
compared to ess - a , tal offers a less doughy bagel !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee ! !
O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O
a little crowded but they move that line really fast !
O O O O O O O O O O O
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O
the turkey burgers are scary !
O B-neg E-neg O O O
the sushi was awful !
O B-neg O O O
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O
the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
O B-neg O O O O O O O
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O
good , fast service .
O O O B-pos O
the location is perfect .
O B-pos O O O
give it a try and enjoy .
O O O O O O O
i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan exprience .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you ' ll love it here .
O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O
would never go back there .
O O O O O O
that place was awesome , , , sally !

awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice .

great atmoshere and worth every bit .
O B-pos O O O O O
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
B-pos O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O
the food is reliable and the price is moderate .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O
what more can you ask for ?
O O O O O O O
for authentic thai food , look no further than toons .
O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O
try the pad thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu . . . they ' re all delicious .
O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O
the service was attentive , yet discreet .
O B-pos O O O O O O
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m saving up for my next visit .
O O O O O O O O O O
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service was good and food is wonderful .
B-pos O O O B-pos O O O
i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )
O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O
it is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O
the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she ' s - way - cuter - than - me - that - b @ # $ * way ) .
O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is yummy , especially their cooked - to - perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O B-pos O
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts .
O O O O O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that ' s about 2 1 / 2 drinks ) for $ 8 . 50 ( i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .

the in - house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can ' t go wrong with this place .
O O O O O O O O B-pos O
suan is a great place that i often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O
i love their thai
O O O B-pos
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must !
B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O
i was in love with pongsri on 48th , but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will go back to suan soon !
O O O O O B-pos O O
i cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O
i cannot imagine better indian food in all of the city .
O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O
i cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O B-neg O O O O O O O O O
i wish they would change back to what it was before .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food now is inconsistent .
O B-neg O O O O
this is the kind of place you ' d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setting is casual and romantic .
O B-pos O O O O O
prices are very good .

the food is excellent !

if you ' re daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it ' s wonderful !

do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .

the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .
O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .
O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you don ' t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O B-neg I-neg E-neg O B-neg E-neg O
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st . just south of bayard
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was pleasantly suprised .
O O O O O
the food was exceptional .
O B-pos O O O
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like balthazar etc .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
O B-pos O O O O B-neu O O O
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
O O B-pos O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O
i would just ask for no oil next time .
O O O O O O O O O O
finally a reliable chinese restaurant !
O O O B-pos E-pos O
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut - down .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
never fails to please .
O O O O O
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
B-neg O B-neg O O O O O O O O
service is fast and friendly .
B-pos O O O O O
only drawback - they won ' t toast your bagel , and they don ' t make eggs for the bagel .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but that is highly forgivable .
O O O O O O
the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it ' s a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .
O B-neg O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you ' ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rao is a good restaurant , but it ' s nothing special .
B-neu O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve eaten at many different indian restaurants .
O O O O O O O O O O
but after last night , spice grill is the only place i ' m eating indian cuisine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O
you must try the shrimp appetizers .
O O O O B-pos E-pos O
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
O O O O O O B-pos O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O
it ' s a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O
i really loved the different and inovated touch that ' s the cheff gives to the food .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O
also it ' s great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it ' s just perfect . . . they ' re so frendly that we never want to live the place !

i love ess - a - bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray ' s for convenience .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ' special ' bagel experience .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
O O O O O O O O O O O
great bagels made the old - fashioned way .
O B-pos O O O O O O O
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
drawbacks : service is slow and they don ' t toast !
O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O
the food was absolutely amazing ! !

the baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we ' ve ever had ! !

go there once and oh yes . . . you will go back . . . you will . . .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best .

the only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O B-pos O
wonderful at holiday time .
O O O O O
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
O O B-pos O O O O O O O O
service was very prompt but slightly rushed .

go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
too bad the food wasn ' t of the same heritage .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
a real dissapointment .
O O O O
but that wasn ' t the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips - good but a far cry from what the name implies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
priced at upper intermediate range .
O O O O O O
i really liked this place .
O O O O B-pos O
everything i had was good , and i ' m a eater .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was pretty inexpensive too .
O O O O O O
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city .
O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O
it ' s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .

it just wasn ' t thai .
O O O O O O O
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as i love la pizza fresca ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pizza was a little soggy .

not enough wines by the glass either .

the mussles were the fishiest things i ' ve ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it . . . it was disgusting .

i got the $ 10 10 - piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
O O O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O
but $ 1 for each small piece ? ? ?

the decor is very simple but comfortable .

the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .

obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity .

simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices . . .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you don ' t mind pre - sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O B-neg O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O
wasn ' t going to share but i feel obligated . . . while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .

fabulous decor - makes you feel like you ' re in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply - priced , generally friendly staff , and if you ' re a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , rice avenue will make you feel at home . . . . . very soho / village / upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele . . . . . all on roosevelt avenue !

we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were then shooed inside .
O O O O O O
one would think we ' d get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter wouldn ' t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we left , never to return .

with so many good restaurants on the uws , i don ' t need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait - staff who don ' t recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that doesn ' t care .

i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .

if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town .
O O O O O O O O O O
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
O B-neu O O O O O O O O O
you can ' t say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they ' re are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing , queens .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
baluchi ' s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
B-pos I-pos E-pos O O B-pos O O O B-pos O O O O
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .
O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O
he offers subpar service and has no personality .
O O O B-neg O O O O O
in fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
skip this location and go to the one in soho .
O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no excuse for such lousy service !
O O O O O O O B-neg O
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing .

i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20 ' s / 30 year olds also .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
O B-pos O O O O O O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O O
me and my girls will definitely go back .
O O O O O O O O O
food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went .
B-pos O O O O B-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .

personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .

there is a downside if you ' re ordering in - - the delivery guys have major attitude .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O
never have i had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b / c i live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .
O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hey , i think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ain ' t bad .

we got most of it back at home with us .

i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can ' t not mention or undermine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest . . tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne . . . got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed . . . lol
O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O B-pos O O O O
over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family - - although with all the business this not - so - little gem does , it amazing he ' s even able to remember a consistent but not - so - frequent visitor .

i ' ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !

way below average

i think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .

the potato balls were not dry at all . . . in fact it was buttery .

the only downside . . . they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ll be back for sure .

red dragon roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down
B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll .
O O O B-pos O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O
if you don ' t like it , i don ' t know what to tell you .

the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly .

favorite sushi in nyc
O B-pos O O
i have eaten at some of the ' best ' sushi joints in nyc ( nobu , bond street , jewelbako , etc ) and yamato is my favorite .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
an unpretentious spot in park slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .
O O B-pos O O O O O B-pos O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O
in the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .

gross food – wow -
O B-neg O O O
i can ' t remember the last time i had such gross food in new york .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O
my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three - year old with no sense of proportion or flavor .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?
O O O O O O O O B-neg O
come on .
O O O
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
really , i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds - - this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9 / 10 of which are way better than this one .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save your money and your time and go somewhere else .
O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , and i never write reviews - - i just was so moved by how bad this place was , i felt it was my duty to spread the word .

best indian restaurant in the city
O B-pos E-pos O O O
small , bright , and clean , bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in astoria and out .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .
O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O B-pos O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - - if you don ' t eat one your trip was wasted .

during our trip to nyc , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pre - theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the " free " appetizer of olives was disappointing .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O
however , our main course was wonderful .
O O O B-pos E-pos O O O
i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .
O O B-pos O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O
the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neu O
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O
short and sweet – seating is great : it ' s romantic , cozy and private .

O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .

over .

over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .

so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .

maggot in the food !
O O O B-neg O
i ' ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that ' s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .
O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i didn ' t think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we paid and left because we didn ' t feel like arguing any more .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .

the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .
O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O
my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .

still we keep going back : )
O O O O O O O
rather than eating the meat entree being offered , i requested a vegetarian dish .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .
O O O B-neg E-neg O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so stunned , and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .

this establishment is the real deal .
O B-pos O O O O O
this is a twenty - something guy that doesn ' t mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
are you freaking kidding me ?
O O O O O O
look , the appetizers were really good .
O O O B-pos O O O O
the entree was also very good .
O B-pos O O O O O
can ' t argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .
O O O O O O O B-neu O O O O
yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
$ 500 included :
O O O O
drinks : 2 glasses of dom perignon at $ 35 each .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef .
O O O O O O O O O O O
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a beef consomme .
O O O O
entrees : vanison steak and bison steak .

vanison was good but not amazing .

i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was wrong .
O O O O
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say " i ' ve been to the four seasons restaurant " .
B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it .

all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O B-neg O O
the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
O B-neu O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .
O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
yes , it is good , but i ' ve had better for cheaper .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .

i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !
O O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O
but not in a good way .
O O O O O O O
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .

we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place is beautiful !

the hostess was very pleasant .
O B-pos O O O O
however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !

once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for each course we waited over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .
O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O
we asked for beverages and never received them .
O O O O O O O O O
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !

to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !

if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended . . . and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !

i wish i could be refunded !

i went here for a family birthday dinner .
O O O O O O O O O
five of us walked in at approximately 6 : 20 on a thursday evening .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hostess said " wow that ' s a large group , unless you aren ' t together " , to which i replied " no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . "
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .
O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .
O O O O B-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .
O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she replied " well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . "
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food arrived in about 15 minutes .
O O O O O O O O
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !
O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O
i heard the lobster roll was excellent .
O O O B-pos E-pos O O O
all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .
O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service not the friendliest to our " large party " !

great indian food
O B-pos E-pos
i lived on 50th st , and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i ' ve had .
B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very " normal indian food " , but done really well .
O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place doesn ' t have an upscale feel .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O B-neg O
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .
O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i don ' t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron ' s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

wretched and retching
O O O
this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O B-neg O
for starters they delivered us someone else ' s order .
O O O O O O O O O O O
fine , i wont hang you for that .
O O O O O O O O O
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .
O O O O O O O O O O O
eat at your own risk .

gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner

the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !

my wife and i visited dokebi tonight .
O O O O O O O O
we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi - bokum .
O O O O O O O O O
the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl wasn ' t even close to sizzling .
O B-neu O O O O O B-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg E-neg O
the nakgi - bokum was horrible .
O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O
easily the worst stir - fried squid i ' ve ever tasted .
O O O B-neg I-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .
O B-neu E-neu O O O O O O O O O O O O
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O
i mentioned the squid dish wasn ' t very good when the waitress visited .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she just nodded and walked off .
O O O O O O O
there were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect english .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were charged full price .
O O O O O O
authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street , of course .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
lives up to the hype
O O O O O
we ' ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ' ve tried before but it always packed and doesn ' t take reservations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it doesn ' t look appetizing as it ' s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .
O B-pos E-pos O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
O O B-pos E-pos O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos
love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .
O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .
O O B-neu I-neu I-neu E-neu O
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .

possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city
O O O O B-pos O O O
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
O O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-neu O O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O
my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !

i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce .
O O O O O O O O O O O
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .
O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .
O O O O O O O O O O
i don ’ t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O
terrible would be a compliment !
O O O O O O
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .

i go here at least once every other week , particularly when it ' s cold !

to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu .
O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried a couple other dishes but wasn ' t too impressed .
O O O O O B-neu O O O O O O O
but for the shabu shabu , you won ' t find much better in ny .

in fact there is only one i ' ve tried that even compares ( shabu tatsu ) and even then i prefer dokebi .

the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn ' t work .

the food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .

go to japanese sushi place or spanish tapas place - this creation in williamsburg is a misstake .

good food
O B-pos
i went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .
O O O O O O O O O O
over all it was a very nice romantic place .
O O O O O O O O B-pos O
i would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O
the food we ordered was excellent , although i wouldn ' t say the margaritas were anything to write home about .
O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neu O O O O O O O
our waitress wasn ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .
O B-neu O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O
maybe it has improved since then ?

this was , from start to finish , a mind - bogglingly uncomfortable experience .

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
polite acknowledgement is out ;
O O O O O
supercilious scorn is in .
O O O O O
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .
O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O
the place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )
O O O O O B-pos I-pos E-pos O O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you ' re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on that scale , it ' s a world - beater .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
how is this palce still open ?
O O O B-neg O O O
i honestly don ' t even know where to begin .
O O O O O O O O O O O
my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was going good until we got our meals .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .
O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de - skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i couldn ' t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had better chicken at bbqs ! ! ! !
O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier " no apology , nothing .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the level of rudeness was preposterous .
O O O O O O O
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos O B-pos O O O O O
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience .

casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes you pay a lot and don ' t get much in return - it ' s manhattan , things are expensive .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place . . . god where do i begin .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O
it is quite a spectacular scene i ' ll give them that .
O O O O O B-pos O O O O O O O

O O B-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .

but nonetheless - - great spot , great food .

each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .

a word to the wise : you can ' t dine here and disturb the maitre - d ' s sense of " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you go here , do it on his off - night .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best meal in a long time !
O B-pos O O O O O
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .
B-pos O B-pos O O O O O
the food is great and the environment is even better .
O B-pos O O O O B-pos O O O O
everyone must come here at least once .
O O O O O O O O
highly recommend it !

taking hot dogs to the next level
O B-pos E-pos O O O O
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you don ' t just get your average hot dog .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .
O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great atmosphere
O B-pos
went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .
O O O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O
cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .
O B-pos O O B-pos E-pos O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
poor service and management
O B-neg O B-neg
don ’ t go to this place !

had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .
O O O O O B-neg I-neg E-neg O O O O O
appetizers took nearly an hour .
O O O O O O
never got an explanation as to what was going on .
O O O O O O O O O O O
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can ’ t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
the food is very good , but not outstanding .
O B-neu O O O O O O O O
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O B-neg O O O O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine . . . but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O
without the wait or attitude , i would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and don ' t make me jump through hoops .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
expensive
O
i went there after hearing how great it was .
O O O O O O O O O O
wow .
O O
the bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .
O B-neg O O O O B-neg O O O O O
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so rude ! ! !
O O O O O
her review is above .
O O O O O
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , " can i help you " and " how many are in your party . "
O O O O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non - existent customer service .
O O O O O O O O B-neg O O O O B-neg E-neg O
bad staff
O B-neg
i generally like this place .
O O O O B-pos O
the food is good .
O B-pos O O O
the design of the space is good .
O O O O B-pos O O O
but the service is horrid !
O O B-neg O O O
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .
O B-neg O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .
